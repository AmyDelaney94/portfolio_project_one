This is the repository of my first portfolio project. This project will focus on the use of both HTML and CSS.

Title: Online Resume 
Online Resume is a site that is designed to display an online version of my resume. It is intended to target potential employers and recruiters. In this project I hope to accomplish a clear design and portrayal of information about me, including an about me section, a brief employment history, a  summary of my previous education, a gallery of images showing my hobbies and finally a page allowing recruiters to contact me for my references. As I am looking to change my career field, I am hoping this site will show prospective employers my skill.
