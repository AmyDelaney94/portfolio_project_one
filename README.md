# portfolio_project_one
This is the repository of my first portfolio project. This project will focus on the use of both HTML and CSS.

# Title: Online Resume 
Online Resume is a site that is designed to display an online version of my resume. It is intended to target potential employers and recruiters. In this project I hope to accomplish a clear design and portrayal of information about me, including an about me section, a brief employment history, a  summary of my previous education, a gallery of images showing my hobbies and finally a page allowing recruiters to contact me for my references. As I am looking to change my career field, I am hoping this site will show prospective employers my skill. 

## Features     
### Navigation Bar ->
This navigation bar will be featured on each of the three pages with active links to the Home Page, Experience Page and Contact Page. The section is designed to allow the user to navigate between pages in order to get a full image of my employment and education history. 

### Site logo 
As this is an online resume I chose the logo as 'Curriculum Vitae'
